# Dosage-Optimization-for-Poultry-Product
Product Development
Microsintesis| [Jun_2024]
Objective
Designed and implemented a dosage model aimed at optimizing product usage during a 35-day treatment period for poultry, ensuring precise administration of a target 12 mg/kg dosage to reduce wastage and lower the cost of goods.

Data Analysis
Data Cleaning & Extraction: Reviewed and analyzed dosage spreadsheets for patterns using advanced data cleaning and extraction techniques.
Test Models Creation: Developed test models for dosage optimization based on data trends, leveraging Excel, Python, and bin clustering methods to eliminate dosage variability.
Equal-Width Binning: Applied equal-width binning to cluster dosage ranges, resulting in an optimal scoop dosage configuration that reduced both overdosing and underdosing by approximately 17%.
Data Visualization: Generated visualizations to track dosage delivery patterns using data visualization tools, identifying trends and aligning dosage to bird age, weight, and water intake.
Optimization Outcomes
Wastage Reduction: Reduced product wastage by over 50% in the early stages of treatment, significantly cutting costs. The new dosage model saved $102.50 per 20,000 birds, compared to previous costs of $204.99.
Balanced Delivery: Achieved a balanced and optimized delivery of the poultry product by creating a module that considered bird weight, water intake, and treatment duration.
Streamlined Production: The final model streamlined production while maintaining product efficacy and meeting regulatory compliance for animal treatment.
